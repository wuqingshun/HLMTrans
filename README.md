# HLMTrans

In this repository, we have open sourced a Sim-to-Real Transfer with Human-guided Language Models framework called **HLMTrans**, which comprises three key components: *RLM decision for task assignment*, *sim-to-real transfer with large language model (LLM)*, and *preference learning from human feedback*. HLMTrans leverages the human-guided LLMs' inference ability to understand how traffic states, road types, and weather conditions influence system dynamics, the travel time is estimate and grounded based on realistic dynamics, thus help the RLMs learn a more realistic policy.
